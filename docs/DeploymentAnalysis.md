📊 Analysis & Recommendations
Part 1: Azure Deployment Method
✅ Your Current Deployment is EXCELLENT!
Your GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main_ocelisconfigurator.yml) is using best practices for Azure App Service deployment:
What You're Doing Right:
✅ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Automatic deployment on push to main
Manual trigger option with workflow_dispatch
✅ Proper Build Process
Builds in Release configuration
Uses dotnet publish (not just build)
Artifact-based deployment (build once, deploy once)
✅ Modern Azure Authentication
Uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) instead of publish profile
More secure than username/password
Uses Azure managed identities
✅ Separation of Build and Deploy
Build job runs on Ubuntu (faster, cheaper)
Deploy job downloads artifact
Clean separation of concerns
This is the RIGHT deployment method! 🎉
Alternative methods (not recommended for your case):
❌ Manual FTP deployment (outdated, error-prone)
❌ Visual Studio publish (not automated)
❌ Azure CLI manual deployment (requires manual steps)
⚠️ Docker containers (overkill for a simple Blazor app)
Recommendation: Keep your current deployment method. It's modern, secure, and follows Azure best practices.
